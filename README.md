## Libraries

Every `.hpp` file in `include/itlib` is a standalone library and has no dependencies other than the standard lib.

Documentation is provided in comments at the top of each file.

In the list below each library shows its minimum supported C++ standard and has icons for other standards if additional features are available for them.

 Library | Description
---------|-------------
 [**any.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/blob/master/include/itlib/any.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | An alternative implementation of C++17's `std::any` without the limitation of required copyability for the values inside and with the possibility to set a custom allocator.
 [**atomic.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/blob/master/include/itlib/atomic.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | Utility extensions for `<atomic>`.
 [**atomic_shared_ptr_storage.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/blob/master/include/itlib/atomic_shared_ptr_storage.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A wrapper for `std::shared_ptr<T>` which allows atomic load, store and exchange. An alternative to C++20's `std::atomic<std::shared_ptr<T>>`.
 [**data_mutex.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/blob/master/include/itlib/data_mutex.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-17-red.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A template pair of an object and a mutex used to synchronize access to it.

It's also somewhat similar to `std::vector<bool>`, but (so far) it has more limited modification capabilities.
 [**expected.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/blob/master/include/itlib/expected.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A union type of a value and an error. Similar to the [`std::expected`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected) from C++23.
 [**flat_map.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/blob/master/include/itlib/flat_map.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A class with the interface of `std::map` but implemented with an underlying `std::vector`-type container, thus providing better cache locality of the elements. Similar to [`boost::flat_map`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost/container/flat_map.html) with the notable difference that the underlying container can be changed via a template argument.
 [**flat_set.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/blob/master/include/itlib/flat_set.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A class with the interface of `std::set` but implemented with an underlying `std::vector`-type container, thus providing better cache locality of the elements. Similar to [`boost::flat_set`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost/container/flat_set.html) with the notable difference that the underlying container can be changed via a template argument.

This fact is used to improve performance by skipping constructor and destructor calls and using `memcpy` and `memmove` to copy data, and `malloc` and `free`, and, most importantly `realloc`, and `_expand` if available, to manage memory.
 [**poly_span.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/tree/master/include/itlib/poly_span.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A class similar to C++20's `std::span` which offers a polymorphic view over a buffer of objects.
 [**qalgorithm.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/tree/master/include/itlib/qalgorithm.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | Wrappers of `<algorithm>` functions which work on entire containers for less typing in the most common use-cases.
 [**rstream.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/tree/master/include/itlib/rstream.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | Read stream.

Works with C++11, but it's slightly easier to use with C++17.
 [**shared_from.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/tree/master/include/itlib/shared_from.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A helper class to replace `std::enable_shared_from_this` providing a more powerful interface.

 [**small_vector.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/tree/master/include/itlib/small_vector.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A mix between `std::vector` and `itlib::static_vector`. It's a dynamic array, optimized for use when the number of elements is small. Like `static_vector` is has a static buffer with a given capacity, but can fall back to dynamically allocated memory, should the size exceed it. Similar to [`boost::small_vector`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost/container/small_vector.html)
 [**span.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/tree/master/include/itlib/span.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-17-red.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A C++11 implementation of C++20's `std::span`

This allows you to have dynamically sized vectors on the stack or as cache-local value members, as long as you know a big enough capacity beforehand. Similar to [`boost::static_vector`](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/doc/html/boost/container/static_vector.html).
 [**stride_span.hpp**](https://github.com/iboB/itlib/tree/master/include/itlib/stride_span.hpp) [![Standard](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-11-blue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B#Standardization) | A C++11 implementation C++20's of std::span with a dynamic extent *and an associated stride*.
